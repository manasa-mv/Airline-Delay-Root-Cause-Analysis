# ✈️ Airline Delay Root Cause Analysis (5.8M Flights)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes 5.8 million US flight records (2015 dataset) to identify the major root causes of flight delays and seasonal patterns.

The objective was to:
- Identify the most impactful delay causes
- Analyze correlation with arrival delay
- Study monthly trends
- Perform normalized seasonal analysis

---

## 📊 Dataset
- 5,819,079 flight records
- 31 features
- ~1.3GB dataset
- Year: 2015 US Flights
